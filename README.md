# EasyBukkitPluginCreator
A Bukkit Plugin creator which requires no programming knowledge. A successor to the CraftBukkitIDE (And similar projects)

Lets see. 17th June 2014. It's been just over 6 months since that date. The date that I decided to create the CraftBukkitIDE. Well now is the time for revolutionizing the project that I had created a while ago.

Something... better. Something that will actually be complete. Something that actually requires no programming knowledge.

#### I present, the EasyBukkitPluginCreator.
A Bukkit plugin maker which is designed for extreme ease of use.

* No programming knowledge required. AT ALL. Like seriously, you can have the mental capability of a 6 year old and should still be able to use this program effectively.
* Nice cozy GUI to make things nice and simple

I'm now 16 years old. A little wiser, a little better at coding. I have picked up on the mistakes in the past few months and further expanded my Java knowledge. I am nearing my GCSE's (O levels) and am beginning to think about my upcoming exams. Unfortunately, I have other things on my mind. This is one of them.

By creating the EasyBukkitPluginCreator, I hope that I can encourage Minecraft to be a little bit more active and give the ability for those young players out there (6 - 16) the chance to create their own servers with their own plugins. Let them run the show how they want it. Don't let them have the simple constraints of not being able to learn Java (or Python or whatever other languages you can write Bukkit Plugins in nowadays).

It's time for change. And now is the best time than any other.

## Credits
* I want to thank my friend Tundraboy44 because he has been one of the greatest motivators in my entire developing career. He never gave up on me and has always been able to cheer me up and bring my hopes up to par. He's been there for me and I want to show him that I am able to give something in return for both him and the Minecraft community.
* I also want to thank a guy called Gianluca who has been a fellow developer and has always been asking for help. The best thing about being self-taught Java and helping another developer is that I learn from teaching and he learns from my teaching and together, we have been able to accomplish many things. (Or rather, I have helped him accomplish many things and by helping him, I have learnt a lot)
